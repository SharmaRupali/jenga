# Jenga

__Jenga__ is a collection of machine learning tasks that allow researchers to study the effect of common data corruptions 
(e.g., missing values, broken character encodings) on the prediction quality of a class of popular ML algorithms.

Its goal is to help find methods to detect such errors early and make models robust against them. We provide a set of example 
notebooks showcasing the different tasks and data corruptions covered in __Jenga__:

 * [Predicting the helpfulness of video game reviews](example-reviews.ipynb)
 * [Distinguishing images of sneakers from images of ankle boots](example-shows.ipynb)
 * [Predicting future movie ratings](example-movieratings.ipynb)

__Jenga__ is part of our ongoing research efforts:

 * Sebastian Schelter, Tammo Rukat, Felix Biessmann (2020). [Learning to Validate the Predictions of Black Box Classifiers on Unseen Data.](https://ssc.io/pdf/mod0077s.pdf) ACM SIGMOD. 
 * Tammo Rukat, Dustin Lange, Sebastian Schelter, Felix Biessmann (2020): [Towards Automated ML Model Monitoring: Measure, Improve and Quantify Data Quality.](https://ssc.io/pdf/autoops.pdf) ML Ops workshop at the Conference on Machine Learning and Systems&nbsp;(MLSys).
